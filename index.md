## About Me

I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Sword Health](https://swordhealth.com/) and a PhD student at Instituto Superior Técnico in Lisbon avised by Prof. André Martins and Ricardo Rei. 
I'm currently working on building frontier LLMs for healthcare with a focus on applications for mental health, and I'm particularly interested in the automatic evaluation of such models.
Previously, I worked on multilingual LLMs at Unbabel, and fairness-aware ML for fraud detection at Feedzai.
